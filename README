This readme will serve as the design document of nesblox.

Part 1: Gameplay
=================

The gameplay of nesblox is going to be pretty simple.
The objective of the game is to move the player character throuhg a maze 
made of of blocks with certain rules (like one way blocks) without crossing its own path.
There will be several obsticle blocks.
The game should have a built in map editor with which maps can be designed. 
Maps will be saved to sram.
All maps will fit on one screen.
There will be at least 32 built in maps and 4-6 slots for player defined maps.
The map editor needs to be able to compress maps. 
The map loader will be able to uncompress them. 
All maps will be stored somewhere in ram as well as in screen ram.
Map updates will take place both in ram and screen ram to keep copies consistent.
The map editor will allow placing any available tile anywhere on the screen.
The main menu will simply consist of a map picker.
The map editor will have a save menu where a map slot will be picked.

Part 2: Other features
=======================
The game should be available for free and as a payed version on steam distributed using an open source 
nes emulator. 
The steam release should have a launcher that allows users to pick sram files downloaded from the steam workshop.
It should also allow uploading the users sram file to the workshop.
This will be the main feature of them game: Shareable maps over the internet.
The sram will not contain anything but map files.
The game should use a mapper with as little features as possible.
Generally a few banks of rom should do to contain the game.
One bank of sram should also be enough depending on how well compression works.

All graphics design can be easily done using Mesens PPU viewer.
Once done simply export the CHR ROM to a dump and it can be included using .incbin.
