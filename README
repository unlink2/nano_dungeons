InfinyJump is an infite runner for the Atari 2600 written
using my assembler lasm. This project serves to test 
the functionality of the assembler.

TODO:

Implement collision
After certain score add Bird that flies at top of screen

use missile objects as "invisible" collision helpers for left/right collision 
only if missile does not collide but p0 did allow jump
